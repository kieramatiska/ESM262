I am taking this course because I am interested in R coding and data analysis. I want to learn more skills that will help my coding and I want to be able to practice with R more. Practice allows you to improve and without a class, I do not think I would practice.

I don't have much of a data science background. My data science background consists of the introductory data science course here at Bren and advanced data analysis, which I am taking currently.
